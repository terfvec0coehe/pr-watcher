# Differential Calculus by Abdul Matin PDF Download: A Comprehensive Guide for Students
 
Differential calculus is one of the most important branches of mathematics, with applications in physics, engineering, economics, and many other fields. It deals with the study of rates of change, slopes, curves, and functions. Differential calculus can help you solve problems such as finding the maximum or minimum value of a function, optimizing a system, modeling a phenomenon, or analyzing a graph.

In this section, we will review some of the basic concepts and definitions of differential calculus. We will also introduce some notation and terminology that will be used throughout the book.
 
## Limits and Continuity
 
A limit is a way of describing the behavior of a function as its input approaches a certain value. For example, consider the function f(x) = (x^2 - 1) / (x - 1). What happens to f(x) as x gets closer and closer to 1? We can see that f(x) is undefined at x = 1, because the denominator becomes zero. However, we can also see that f(x) gets closer and closer to 2 as x approaches 1 from either side. We can write this as:
 
lim(x->1) f(x) = 2
 
This means that the limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 is equal to 2. In other words, f(x) can be made arbitrarily close to 2 by choosing x sufficiently close to 1. Note that the value of f(1) does not matter for the limit; it only depends on the values of f(x) near 1.
 
A function is continuous at a point if its value at that point is equal to its limit at that point. For example, the function g(x) = x^2 is continuous at x = 1, because g(1) = 1 and lim(x->1) g(x) = 1. A function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in that interval. For example, g(x) is continuous on the interval [0, 2], because it is continuous at every point between 0 and 2.
 
Continuity is an important property of functions, because it ensures that the function does not have any gaps, jumps, or breaks in its graph. Continuous functions are easier to work with and have many nice properties.
