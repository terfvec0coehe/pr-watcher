If you want to download and install this mod, you will need a copy of Jedi Academy patched to v1.01 and a clear base folder with no other mods. You can follow these steps to get started:
 
1. Download the KotF Beta zip file from this link: [https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1EfuQNSOO9jNkQRzuAFYUxmpRu5I\_B8Nt](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1EfuQNSOO9jNkQRzuAFYUxmpRu5I_B8Nt) [^1^]
2. Locate the folder named "KotF" and extract it into your Gamedata folder. Do not extract the contents of the KotF folder into your Gamedata folder.
3. Locate the folder named "KotF-Windows" and open it. You will see a folder named "Gamedata". Open the "Gamedata" folder.
4. Inside of the KotF-Windows/Gamedata folder, you will see multiple files and another KotF folder. Extract all of the files and the KotF folder into your Jedi Academy Gamedata folder.
5. Run either KotF 2.1 SP or KotF 2.1 MP as an administrator. To set this to default, right click either file and select "Properties". Navigate to the "Compatibility" tab and check the box labelled "Run this program as an administrator". Click Apply and close. Repeat for the other exe file if necessary.
6. Start the mod using only either "KotF 2.1 SP" or "KotF 2.1 MP".
7. Have fun!
